# robindrew-trading-activetick
ActiveTick provider for the robindrew-trading project

You will need to sign up for a developer account and subscribe to one or more feeds to use this provider.

Includes all code necessary to connect to the Active Tick API, including the atapi jar.

The Active Tick provider only supports historic and streaming price access - it does **not** support trading.
